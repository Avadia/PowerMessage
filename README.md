PowerMessage
=========

**PowerMessage is no longer being maintained. Instead, you can make use of the newer, more up-to-date messages API present in [Commodus](https://github.com/DSH105/Commodus) (based on PowerMessage), first drafted in [this commit](https://github.com/DSH105/Commodus/commit/8f430a001676a973b91d89e7e6b106cdd3da24b3). The newer API facilitates similiar functionality to this library with in-built support for SpongeAPI.**

**Note: if you are using PowerMessage in a plugin built purely for Bukkit, it will still work just fine :).**

Modification of [Fanciful by mkremins](http://github.com/mkremins/fanciful)

Allows the sending of cool, interactive messages to player clients through internal manipulation of JSON. Plugins using this don't have to worry about any of that though :3
